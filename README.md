- The results are saved in the `companies.txt` file.

### 2. Searching for GitHub Links
- Using the Google API to search for all GitHub links related to company names from `companies.txt`.
- The results are recorded in the `Git List.txt` file.

### 3. Filtering Results
- The `filter.go` script processes the `Git List.txt` file, extracting possible links to the companies' GitHub profiles.

### 4. Analyzing Repositories
- The `GetTop.go` script outputs the top repositories containing the word "ROS" in their description to the console.
